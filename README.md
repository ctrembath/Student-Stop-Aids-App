# Would you Rather?

## Synopsis

Team Stop Aids, working with the charity Students Stop Aids are proud to present <i>Would You Rather?<i>

Students Stop Aids wanted to give students another way to engage with their local candidates in the run up to the 2015 General Election, something a little less stifly formal than the existing options. So, they approached Makers Academy about creating a would you rather game that lets students ask fun and pertinant questions of their local candidate. 
Our team loved the idea of working with a charity client and creating something that could be used in the real world to meet real needs! Rising to the challange with this flowing, colourful webapp which we hope shows the potential of this idea.
